A fork of awesome work by [@jeffreyguenther](https://github.com/jeffreyguenther) for [zed-shopify-liquid](https://github.com/TheBeyondGroup/zed-shopify-liquid)

This extension uses [grammar](https://github.com/hankthetank27/tree-sitter-liquid) and queries from [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/tree/master/queries/liquid)
